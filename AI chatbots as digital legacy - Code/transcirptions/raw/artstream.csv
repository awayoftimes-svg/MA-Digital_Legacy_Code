00:00:00,,I already announced that this is going to be extremely disappointing.,artstream,46
00:00:00,,And I think that Sisi doesn't want to have this picture.,artstream,47
00:00:00,,Honestly.,artstream,48
00:00:00,,Oh no.,artstream,49
00:00:00,,He looks a little depressed.,artstream,50
00:00:00,,But that's okay.,artstream,51
00:00:00,,"Why does he have such a crazy song shadow, bro?",artstream,52
00:00:00,,"Finally stream, yippie.",artstream,53
00:00:00,,Yes.,artstream,54
00:00:00,,And it's going to be terrible.,artstream,55
00:00:00,,It's going to be a terrible bubble.,artstream,56

00:00:00,,"Okay, that's his chin.",artstream,58
00:00:00,,And here is the mouth.,artstream,59
00:00:00,,Oh god.,artstream,60

00:00:00,,"Wait, it's starting to look like bubbles.",artstream,63
00:00:00,,"It's not that bad, okay?",artstream,64
00:00:00,,Okay?,artstream,65
00:00:00,,I heard it loudly and didn't buy a seat.,artstream,66
00:00:00,,Shit.,artstream,67
00:00:00,,And now there are no more seats.,artstream,68
00:00:00,,Oh no.,artstream,69
00:00:00,,I thought you were going to book for both.,artstream,70
00:00:00,,Oh my god.,artstream,71
00:00:00,,I know you can't see it yet.,artstream,72
00:00:00,,But I see it.,artstream,73
00:00:00,,I see bubbles coming here.,artstream,74
00:00:00,,We just have to fix a little bit here.,artstream,75
00:00:00,,We just have to fix a little bit.,artstream,76
00:00:00,,But I see bubbles.,artstream,77
00:00:00,,"But he doesn't look high enough, does he?",artstream,78
00:00:00,,Does he have ears?,artstream,79
00:00:00,,And now the train has a high load and you can't book.,artstream,80
00:00:00,,Shit.,artstream,81
00:00:00,,I'll beat someone up in the train if I have to stand there for 6 hours.,artstream,82
00:00:00,,Yes.,artstream,83
00:00:00,,"It's going to be shit, I tell you.",artstream,84
00:00:00,,"I mean, if there is a high load, is it expected that people have to stand there?",artstream,85
00:00:00,,Or is it actually the case that extra seats are expected?,artstream,86
00:00:00,,I don't know.,artstream,87
00:00:00,,It's an honest question.,artstream,88
00:00:00,,I don't think the eye should be that wide open.,artstream,89
00:00:00,,The mouth is crooked.,artstream,90
00:00:00,,I have to turn the mouth like that.,artstream,91
00:00:00,,I have to turn the mouth like that.,artstream,92
00:00:00,,If I just pay the digital bill now.,artstream,93
00:00:00,,Why didn't anyone tell me that I should do that?,artstream,94
00:00:00,,Children.,artstream,95
00:00:00,,Why didn't anyone tell me that?,artstream,96
00:00:00,,Max didn't even come up with it.,artstream,97
00:00:00,,How do I do this without fucking rubber bands?,artstream,98
00:00:00,,Why don't I have rubber bands?,artstream,99
00:00:00,,"Yes, financial advice.",artstream,100
00:00:00,,"Yes, yes, yes.",artstream,101
00:00:00,,What Bush says.,artstream,102
00:00:00,,I have to actually see that I have a point here.,artstream,103
00:00:00,,And here a point.,artstream,104
00:00:00,,And here a point.,artstream,105
00:00:00,,And here we have another point.,artstream,106
00:00:00,,"And a lot of wimper, but we'll do them later.",artstream,107
00:00:00,,They are also white.,artstream,108
00:00:00,,His fingers have weird tips.,artstream,109
00:00:00,,His head is fucking fat.,artstream,110
00:00:00,,And I think he has a ear.,artstream,111
00:00:00,,I think he has mini ears.,artstream,112
00:00:00,,So I will give him a tiny ear.,artstream,113
00:00:00,,"If you have so many points left, go for it Max.",artstream,114
00:00:00,,I don't think you'll regret that either.,artstream,115
00:00:00,,This is my mix of the week.,artstream,116
00:00:00,,"If you want to change my taste for music, please do it differently.",artstream,117
00:00:00,,Because this is not it.,artstream,118
00:00:00,,I see that there are still a lot of hardeeboos who are at least hypercats.,artstream,119
00:00:00,,Let's see.,artstream,120
00:00:00,,I don't think it's that bad with hardeeboos.,artstream,121
00:00:00,,I'm going to do a chupa chups.,artstream,122
00:00:00,,I'm going to put on some raspberry cream.,artstream,123
00:00:00,,Really cool.,artstream,124
00:00:00,,I'm really looking forward to it.,artstream,125
00:00:00,,I'm thinking about it right now.,artstream,126
00:00:00,,It's the mango that's on offer.,artstream,127
00:00:00,,And I'm actually pretty excited about it.,artstream,128
00:00:00,,But well.,artstream,129
00:00:00,,So now watch out.,artstream,130
00:00:00,,I have to see.,artstream,131
00:00:00,,I'll take this color.,artstream,132
00:00:00,,And that's a good idea.,artstream,133
00:00:00,,Maybe this color.,artstream,134
00:00:00,,I can't do shading kids.,artstream,135
00:00:00,,They're good.,artstream,136
00:00:00,,I think raspberry cream is really nice.,artstream,137
00:00:00,,How are you?,artstream,138
00:00:00,,Blood pressure is lala.,artstream,139
00:00:00,,But it's okay.,artstream,140
00:00:00,,I lived.,artstream,141
00:00:00,,I'm going to sleep.,artstream,142
00:00:00,,"Otherwise, yes.",artstream,143
00:00:00,,I can't complain now.,artstream,144
00:00:00,,I have a vacation next week.,artstream,145
00:00:00,,So I have a vacation from now on.,artstream,146
00:00:00,,"Basically, which is nice.",artstream,147
00:00:00,,I need red for my mouth.,artstream,148
00:00:00,,Maybe this one.,artstream,149
00:00:00,,I'm really excited because I'm on vacation now.,artstream,150
00:00:00,,The weekend is the summer party.,artstream,151
00:00:00,,It stresses me a bit because it's a lot.,artstream,152
00:00:00,,When channel points for iron pill.,artstream,153
00:00:00,,You can actually have an iron overdose.,artstream,154
00:00:00,,Which can end pretty bad.,artstream,155
00:00:00,,"No, no channel points for iron pill.",artstream,156
00:00:00,,We don't do that.,artstream,157
00:00:00,,"Yes, I wasn't that active in the WhatsApp group.",artstream,158
00:00:00,,I always try to read it.,artstream,159
00:00:00,,"But if it's too much, I'll read it.",artstream,160
00:00:00,,I'm not going to read it.,artstream,161
00:00:00,,I'm going to read it.,artstream,162
00:00:00,,I'm going to read it.,artstream,163
00:00:00,,I'm going to read it.,artstream,164
00:00:00,,I always try to read it.,artstream,165
00:00:00,,"But if it's too much, I'll also read it.",artstream,166
00:00:00,,So busy.,artstream,167
00:00:00,,Do I start?,artstream,168
00:00:00,,"No, I start with the base color.",artstream,169
00:00:00,,And the shading.,artstream,170
00:00:00,,And then I do the black at the end.,artstream,171
00:00:00,,And I'm annoyed that I did it like that.,artstream,172
00:00:00,,As always.,artstream,173
00:00:00,,One million channel points for one pill.,artstream,174
00:00:00,,"Yes, okay.",artstream,175
00:00:00,,"Yes, exactly.",artstream,176
00:00:00,,So I have that more often.,artstream,177
00:00:00,,I have that more often too.,artstream,178
00:00:00,,That there are a lot of messages in there.,artstream,179
00:00:00,,Sometimes we just have 300 messages in there.,artstream,180
00:00:00,,"Oh no, I already have color on my fingers.",artstream,181
00:00:00,,Son of a bitch.,artstream,182
00:00:00,,I'm not reading this.,artstream,183
00:00:00,,I can't.,artstream,184
00:00:00,,I can't.,artstream,185
00:00:00,,Is that already open?,artstream,186
00:00:00,,Of course not.,artstream,187
00:00:00,,Do I have to open all of them now?,artstream,188
00:00:00,,Hello.,artstream,189
00:00:00,,"Na, Sisi.",artstream,190
00:00:00,,It's not going to be good.,artstream,191
00:00:00,,I know you want the final product.,artstream,192
00:00:00,,But the final product is not going to be good.,artstream,193
00:00:00,,But nice that you're here.,artstream,194
00:00:00,,"Hello, welcome to my hand stream.",artstream,195
00:00:00,,I actually want to do a round here.,artstream,196
00:00:00,,Oh my god.,artstream,197
00:00:00,,Oh my god.,artstream,198
00:00:00,,"Niklas, now even Bimo got scared.",artstream,199
00:00:00,,Hello.,artstream,200
00:00:00,,"Hello Niklas, thank you for 19 months of sub.",artstream,201
00:00:00,,"The question is now, can you see it?",artstream,202
00:00:00,,"Yes, you can see the pencil through.",artstream,203
00:00:00,,That's good.,artstream,204
00:00:00,,That's all I want.,artstream,205
00:00:00,,That was the goal.,artstream,206
00:00:00,,Boy.,artstream,207
00:00:00,,Oh Niklas.,artstream,208
00:00:00,,That's now painting.,artstream,209
00:00:00,,"But with, um...",artstream,210
00:00:00,,I'm going to fuck you off with how I paint things.,artstream,211
00:00:00,,Because I'm not doing it perfectly now.,artstream,212
00:00:00,,The question is...,artstream,213
00:00:00,,Am I speeding too much?,artstream,214
00:00:00,,How are you?,artstream,215
00:00:00,,I have a little headache.,artstream,216
00:00:00,,But I think that will go away now.,artstream,217
00:00:00,,Because I drank Red Bull.,artstream,218
00:00:00,,And generally now drink more.,artstream,219
00:00:00,,That's just because I drank too little.,artstream,220
00:00:00,,All day.,artstream,221
00:00:00,,Otherwise pretty good.,artstream,222
00:00:00,,I have a holiday from now until the end of next week.,artstream,223
00:00:00,,And I'm going to go to the gym.,artstream,224
00:00:00,,Maybe there are some co-working streams.,artstream,225
00:00:00,,Maybe there are some co-working sessions in the Discord.,artstream,226
00:00:00,,I just fucked off a little bit again.,artstream,227
00:00:00,,Because next month shit gets more expensive.,artstream,228
00:00:00,,"Or not next month, actually this month.",artstream,229
00:00:00,,But I'm pushing everything to next month.,artstream,230
00:00:00,,I just have to pay back taxes from Twitch.,artstream,231
00:00:00,,Then I throw the party.,artstream,232
00:00:00,,Then I'm going to go to the gym.,artstream,233
00:00:00,,And then I'm going to go to the gym.,artstream,234
00:00:00,,And then I'm going to go to the gym.,artstream,235
00:00:00,,And then I'm going to go to the gym.,artstream,236
00:00:00,,And then I'm going to throw a party.,artstream,237
00:00:00,,And then I'm going to throw a party.,artstream,238
00:00:00,,Because this month I have insurance for my car.,artstream,239
00:00:00,,And we want the flights to Japan too.,artstream,240
00:00:00,,"And we want the flights to Japan, so we take a flight to Japan.",artstream,241
00:00:00,,I think I'm simply doing a random Japan stream in Japan.,artstream,242
00:00:00,,Imagine.,artstream,243
00:00:00,,We go for a walk together.,artstream,244
00:00:00,,A really shitty time for you.,artstream,245
00:00:00,,Not my problem.,artstream,246
00:00:00,,How do I do this?,artstream,247
00:00:00,,How do I do this?,artstream,248
00:00:00,,Look at me.,artstream,249
00:00:00,,What am I doing?,artstream,250
00:00:00,,Why am I doing this?,artstream,251
00:00:00,,"Well, whatever.",artstream,252
00:00:00,,The will counts.,artstream,253
00:00:00,,I need a thinner pimple.,artstream,254
00:00:00,,I'm going to buy a new one.,artstream,255
00:00:00,,A video where I walk through Tokyo for hours.,artstream,256
00:00:00,,Sure.,artstream,257
00:00:00,,I'm buying a new one so I don't have to hold the camera.,artstream,258
00:00:00,,Then easy.,artstream,259
00:00:00,,Easy.,artstream,260
00:00:00,,"Easy, easy, easy, easy.",artstream,261
00:00:00,,"Oh, fuck it.",artstream,262
00:00:00,,I fucked it.,artstream,263
00:00:00,,I can fix it with white.,artstream,264
00:00:00,,It's all good.,artstream,265
00:00:00,,"Oh, no.",artstream,266
00:00:00,,Yes.,artstream,267
00:00:00,,My mom likes to watch this.,artstream,268
00:00:00,,Walking things.,artstream,269

00:00:00,,What color is it?,artstream,274
00:00:00,,He has white eyeshadow.,artstream,275
00:00:00,,Basically.,artstream,276
00:00:00,,"But I have to say, it's therapeutic.",artstream,277
00:00:00,,Just to paint.,artstream,278
00:00:00,,It's fun.,artstream,279
00:00:00,,Even if it's not good.,artstream,280
00:00:00,,It's fun.,artstream,281
00:00:00,,"Thank you, Niklas, for the subgoal.",artstream,282
00:00:00,,Thank you for the subbies.,artstream,283
00:00:00,,It's a good issue.,artstream,284
00:00:00,,And today I'm...,artstream,285

00:00:00,,I'm honest.,artstream,287
00:00:00,,Today I'm pretty fit.,artstream,288
00:00:00,,That's why I wanted to start earlier today.,artstream,289
00:00:00,,I hope it wasn't offensive.,artstream,290
00:00:00,,"And Bush, are you leaving at 8?",artstream,291
00:00:00,,How late is it?,artstream,292
00:00:00,,"Oh, 19.30.",artstream,293
00:00:00,,"Yes, that's a bit untypical for me.",artstream,294
00:00:00,,That's true.,artstream,295
00:00:00,,I'm not too late.,artstream,296
00:00:00,,If you haven't noticed.,artstream,297
00:00:00,,"Oh man, I really don't have a system.",artstream,298
00:00:00,,I would understand.,artstream,299
00:00:00,,I'm doing the foundation now.,artstream,300
00:00:00,,What do I do as background color?,artstream,301
00:00:00,,As...,artstream,302

00:00:00,,Let's go.,artstream,307
00:00:00,,"Have fun with Grounded 2, Niklas.",artstream,308
00:00:00,,I guess you're a bit lurky and don't hear me.,artstream,309
00:00:00,,But still.,artstream,310
00:00:00,,Thanks for the lurk.,artstream,311
00:00:00,,Nice that you're all here.,artstream,312
00:00:00,,Thomas and Sue.,artstream,313
00:00:00,,Why are you streaming on Thursday night?,artstream,314
00:00:00,,It's really late.,artstream,315
00:00:00,,I think it's Thursday night.,artstream,316
00:00:00,,That was the time for shit.,artstream,317
00:00:00,,"Yes, right.",artstream,318
00:00:00,,I hoped there wouldn't be so many to judge my art skills.,artstream,319
00:00:00,,My non-existent art skills.,artstream,320
00:00:00,,I forgot to make sure.,artstream,321
00:00:00,,What?,artstream,322
00:00:00,,What for?,artstream,323
00:00:00,,What for?,artstream,324
00:00:00,,Before what?,artstream,325
00:00:00,,Just health insurance?,artstream,326
00:00:00,,"Yeah, happens.",artstream,327
00:00:00,,But I think it's okay.,artstream,328
00:00:00,,They'll see that you've registered yourself and they'll be pretty nice.,artstream,329
00:00:00,,"I'm lurky, but listen up.",artstream,330
00:00:00,,Let's go.,artstream,331
00:00:00,,I think Bibels has ears.,artstream,332
00:00:00,,"Wait, I have another picture of him.",artstream,333
00:00:00,,"Yes, Bibels has ears.",artstream,334
00:00:00,,But Bibels has other ears!,artstream,335
00:00:00,,"Whatever, I gave him one.",artstream,336
00:00:00,,Well.,artstream,337
00:00:00,,"I'm ear-racist, apparently.",artstream,338
00:00:00,,"I can fix that, too.",artstream,339
00:00:00,,He has ears like this.,artstream,340
00:00:00,,I'm not sure.,artstream,341
00:00:00,,I'm not sure.,artstream,342
00:00:00,,I'm not sure.,artstream,343
00:00:00,,I have ears like this.,artstream,344
00:00:00,,So.,artstream,345
00:00:00,,Bibels is my spirit animal.,artstream,346
00:00:00,,I'm basically painting a portrait of Sisi.,artstream,347
00:00:00,,But I'm sorry.,artstream,348
00:00:00,,I'm not going to be fair to you.,artstream,349
00:00:00,,I wish I could.,artstream,350
00:00:00,,I would love to draw oil paintings like that.,artstream,351
00:00:00,,Flirty Bibels will be channeled.,artstream,352
00:00:00,,"Yes, Sisi.",artstream,353
00:00:00,,Where is the Flirty Bibels?,artstream,354
00:00:00,,Here.,artstream,355
00:00:00,,I'm sorry I can't get to the chat.,artstream,356
00:00:00,,"I'm always on the canvas, obviously.",artstream,357
00:00:00,,Sometimes I skip a few things.,artstream,358
00:00:00,,I hope you can forgive me.,artstream,359
00:00:00,,"Okay, first layer of paint.",artstream,360
00:00:00,,Foundation.,artstream,361
00:00:00,,Then.,artstream,362
00:00:00,,Okay.,artstream,363
00:00:00,,Then I want here.,artstream,364
00:00:00,,I need a little bit of shading here.,artstream,365
00:00:00,,Shading.,artstream,366
00:00:00,,So.,artstream,367
00:00:00,,You can't really blend with acrylic paints.,artstream,368
00:00:00,,I think drunk Sisi will not have her come back.,artstream,369
00:00:00,,Fuck!,artstream,370
00:00:00,,"Nee, das ist okay.",artstream,371
00:00:00,,And then at some point really burned.,artstream,372
00:00:00,,And that's why we have a lot of boxes of beers for free.,artstream,373
00:00:00,,Because they thanked us for that.,artstream,374
00:00:00,,That's all for the summer party.,artstream,375
00:00:00,,...,artstream,376
00:00:00,,...,artstream,377
00:00:00,,Dein Papa hat den Jungen gepaid.,artstream,378

00:00:00,,"Nee, es war richtig crazy.",artstream,380
00:00:00,,Es war einfach sogar die Kripo da.,artstream,381
00:00:00,,Sauviele.,artstream,382
00:00:00,,Also Polizei war da.,artstream,383
00:00:00,,Feuerwehr.,artstream,384
00:00:00,,Kripo.,artstream,385
00:00:00,,"Und das Ding war auch, das hat gebrannt.",artstream,386
00:00:00,,Und irgendwie ein paar Meter neben diesem scheiß Brand war einfach ein Gaskanister und so.,artstream,387
00:00:00,,Also richtig crazy eigentlich.,artstream,388
00:00:00,,"Richtig crazy, dass das meinem Dad halt früh genug aufgefallen ist.",artstream,389
00:00:00,,"Ich habe das Gefühl, das ist nicht die richtige Farbe.",artstream,390
00:00:00,,Das ist zu grün.,artstream,391
00:00:00,,...,artstream,392

00:00:00,,...,artstream,401
00:00:00,,what I'm doing here by the way.,artstream,402
00:00:00,,I'm just vibing.,artstream,403
00:00:00,,That was too much blue.,artstream,404
00:00:00,,I want to have this white blue.,artstream,405
00:00:00,,Very very bright very very bright light blue.,artstream,406
00:00:00,,Let's see what comes out of this color.,artstream,407
00:00:00,,There are three desperadoes of years old parties lying around here.,artstream,408
00:00:00,,"Yes, then drink it.",artstream,409
00:00:00,,Go for it.,artstream,410
00:00:00,,I have so much Bulma cider here now for the summer party.,artstream,411
00:00:00,,And Sekt.,artstream,412
00:00:00,,A little bit of Sekt.,artstream,413
00:00:00,,I think that's more the color of Bibles now.,artstream,414
00:00:00,,You know what I'm saying?,artstream,415
00:00:00,,"Come on, I'll try it now.",artstream,416
00:00:00,,Now it's not that bad with this foundation and stuff.,artstream,417
00:00:00,,But I don't know either.,artstream,418
00:00:00,,I don't know either.,artstream,419
00:00:00,,What's wrong with my mixer?,artstream,420
00:00:00,,It's so epic.,artstream,421
00:00:00,,Synthwave sometimes.,artstream,422
00:00:00,,"Yes, hello.",artstream,423
00:00:00,,Hello.,artstream,424
00:00:00,,I don't know if they still taste good or how the desperado tastes.,artstream,425
00:00:00,,"Yes, try it.",artstream,426
00:00:00,,My first full noise was because of the desperado that my brother gave me.,artstream,427
00:00:00,,Fun fact.,artstream,428
00:00:00,,"And man, I was gone.",artstream,429
00:00:00,,"Well, Lauri, we'll see each other tomorrow.",artstream,430
00:00:00,,"Or the day after tomorrow, at the latest.",artstream,431
00:00:00,,Really crazy.,artstream,432
00:00:00,,"I'm so fucking, I think it's so fucking bad that the weather doesn't even fit.",artstream,433
00:00:00,,"Okay, I want to, I need really dark blue for his eyes.",artstream,434
00:00:00,,Young Tom has such a really cool collection of colors.,artstream,435
00:00:00,,I have to open all of them first.,artstream,436
00:00:00,,He just bought 1000 colors and never used them.,artstream,437
00:00:00,,I would have bought a super cute dress.,artstream,438
00:00:00,,"Well, it's still 22 degrees and it probably won't always rain.",artstream,439
00:00:00,,"I actually need something to clean my brushes here, to be honest.",artstream,440
00:00:00,,But well.,artstream,441
00:00:00,,Does he have a nose hole?,artstream,442
00:00:00,,I guess so.,artstream,443
00:00:00,,"Bibbles, do you have a nose hole?",artstream,444
00:00:00,,How do you stand to have a nose hole?,artstream,445
00:00:00,,"Chat, how do you stand to have a nose hole?",artstream,446
00:00:00,,I'm done already.,artstream,447
00:00:00,,Today was a really crazy surprise.,artstream,448
00:00:00,,"Tomorrow the trains will be full of shit, but I'm not going to let my holiday go to shit.",artstream,449
00:00:00,,"Yes, you got this.",artstream,450
00:00:00,,"You got this, Lauri.",artstream,451
00:00:00,,Riding in a train is just super exhausting.,artstream,452
00:00:00,,Why did I do that?,artstream,453
00:00:00,,Why did I do that?,artstream,454
00:00:00,,"Actually, I have to, he doesn't look that fluffy in the mirror.",artstream,455
00:00:00,,I have to watch me paint and fuck it up.,artstream,456
00:00:00,,How purple are you?,artstream,457
00:00:00,,Do I want...,artstream,458
00:00:00,,I'm a twist pale purple.,artstream,459
00:00:00,,Boy.,artstream,460
00:00:00,,It's more this one.,artstream,461
00:00:00,,Maybe I need this for darker things.,artstream,462
00:00:00,,Mission!,artstream,463
00:00:00,,I'm trying!,artstream,464
00:00:00,,Don't stress me.,artstream,465
00:00:00,,"I'm trying my best, okay?",artstream,466
00:00:00,,Where's the pink brush?,artstream,467
00:00:00,,Did I use it for pink?,artstream,468
00:00:00,,Yes.,artstream,469
00:00:00,,Yes!,artstream,470
00:00:00,,I'm going to paint it.,artstream,471
00:00:00,,I'm going to paint it.,artstream,472
00:00:00,,I'm going to paint it.,artstream,473
00:00:00,,I'm going to paint it.,artstream,474
00:00:00,,Okay.,artstream,475
00:00:00,,Okay.,artstream,476
00:00:00,,I'm going to paint it pink.,artstream,477
00:00:00,,The little tweezers.,artstream,478
00:00:00,,"I've never pulled my nose hair, to be honest.",artstream,479
00:00:00,,Right?,artstream,480
00:00:00,,"I might have tried, but boy, it's so painful, the shit.",artstream,481
00:00:00,,"Explosion, Spirbels.",artstream,482
00:00:00,,I'm putting too much paint on here all the time.,artstream,483
00:00:00,,It's such a waste.,artstream,484
00:00:00,,A wasting color.,artstream,485
00:00:00,,I can't handle acrylic colors that well.,artstream,486
00:00:00,,I had to paint in school and had a time where I painted on canvas.,artstream,487
00:00:00,,"I was like, yes, I really want to paint oil-painting shit.",artstream,488
00:00:00,,Well.,artstream,489
00:00:00,,"I hope you know it, but it was a beautiful dream.",artstream,490
00:00:00,,It was a beautiful dream.,artstream,491
00:00:00,,Honestly.,artstream,492
00:00:00,,So we'll start in the dark and then later on we'll do bright shit.,artstream,493
00:00:00,,I want it to look a little fluffier.,artstream,494
00:00:00,,Yes.,artstream,495
00:00:00,,"I'll turn it around for you, then you can see how it actually looks and not always wrong around here.",artstream,496
00:00:00,,What kind of background color was that?,artstream,497
00:00:00,,"I hope I fixed the mouth enough, to be honest.",artstream,498
00:00:00,,"I hope I fixed the mouth enough, to be honest.",artstream,499
00:00:00,,Pink or flames.,artstream,500
00:00:00,,"I think we have too little background for flames, so that you can actually do it well.",artstream,501
00:00:00,,"No, I painted my documents.",artstream,502
00:00:00,,I had to wash them anyway.,artstream,503
00:00:00,,It's okay.,artstream,504
00:00:00,,"I'm actually most afraid of the outlines, because I can't do it.",artstream,505
00:00:00,,"I'm actually most afraid of the outlines, because I can't do it.",artstream,506
00:00:00,,The people want to flame.,artstream,507
00:00:00,,"Okay, I can try.",artstream,508
00:00:00,,So.,artstream,509
00:00:00,,"Just silly little, no, happy little accidents.",artstream,510
00:00:00,,"Just silly little, no, happy little accidents.",artstream,511
00:00:00,,I was not a wishful child.,artstream,512
00:00:00,,Well.,artstream,513
00:00:00,,"Boy, my mother got a call today from a fake Lena.",artstream,514
00:00:00,,Because I had an accident.,artstream,515
00:00:00,,It was really bad.,artstream,516
00:00:00,,Apparently I cried very hard.,artstream,517
00:00:00,,I said I ran over a pregnant woman.,artstream,518
00:00:00,,She's about to die.,artstream,519
00:00:00,,"Or rather, I didn't say that anymore.",artstream,520
00:00:00,,I said the policewoman I was supposed to hand over the phone to.,artstream,521
00:00:00,,"And that the state law wants 50,000 euros now.",artstream,522
00:00:00,,Whether my mother has so much money.,artstream,523
00:00:00,,Whether she has cash at home to get more money.,artstream,524
00:00:00,,Or valuable items at home that she can sell.,artstream,525
00:00:00,,Because otherwise she can't see me anymore.,artstream,526
00:00:00,,My mother actually bought it very shortly.,artstream,527
00:00:00,,And has already checked how she can make money liquid.,artstream,528
00:00:00,,And how much money is on the daily account and so on.,artstream,529
00:00:00,,The poor mouse was extremely stressed.,artstream,530
00:00:00,,Yes.,artstream,531
00:00:00,,It was fake.,artstream,532
00:00:00,,So it's really hard.,artstream,533
00:00:00,,Really hard scammer was definitely on the way.,artstream,534
00:00:00,,"Sorry, I was just mega in the zone.",artstream,535
00:00:00,,A fake Lena.,artstream,536
00:00:00,,"Yes, I was also talking in dialect.",artstream,537
00:00:00,,Because I was then so to my mom.,artstream,538
00:00:00,,Did they talk in dialect or what?,artstream,539
00:00:00,,I don't want to call and speak in high German with my mother.,artstream,540
00:00:00,,"Yes, everything was in dialect and so on.",artstream,541
00:00:00,,"And really, really, yes, just realistically.",artstream,542
00:00:00,,And my mom did ultranks.,artstream,543
00:00:00,,Obviously.,artstream,544
00:00:00,,Would scare me too.,artstream,545
00:00:00,,"And she says, this is this stupid AI.",artstream,546
00:00:00,,But now she just didn't check.,artstream,547
00:00:00,,"As if public prosecutor asks for 50,000 euros.",artstream,548
00:00:00,,And she can't tell her husband.,artstream,549
00:00:00,,She can't tell my dad.,artstream,550
00:00:00,,Because otherwise she makes herself punishable.,artstream,551
00:00:00,,This is an instant stress situation.,artstream,552
00:00:00,,"Yes, she got ultra in there.",artstream,553
00:00:00,,He was really shaking and so on.,artstream,554
00:00:00,,And just had mega fear.,artstream,555
00:00:00,,And I understand it too.,artstream,556
00:00:00,,I think it's crazy too.,artstream,557
00:00:00,,Looks really good.,artstream,558
00:00:00,,"Thank you, thank you.",artstream,559
00:00:00,,"I'm not convinced yet, but it can only be.",artstream,560
00:00:00,,"I can only be convinced of myself, actually.",artstream,561
00:00:00,,Hi Kai.,artstream,562
00:00:00,,I need.,artstream,563
00:00:00,,"Okay, you're already open.",artstream,564
00:00:00,,"No, they're all half full.",artstream,565
00:00:00,,What kind of shit is that?,artstream,566
00:00:00,,I don't need that color anymore.,artstream,567
00:00:00,,I'm doing it now.,artstream,568
00:00:00,,I'm decent now.,artstream,569
00:00:00,,Did I choose a good color palette?,artstream,570
00:00:00,,I changed a few things.,artstream,571
00:00:00,,It was too green.,artstream,572
00:00:00,,Indeed.,artstream,573
00:00:00,,"So it's still too green, I would say.",artstream,574
00:00:00,,I don't know how fixable it is now.,artstream,575
00:00:00,,I'm going to put a little bit of red.,artstream,576
00:00:00,,A big red.,artstream,577
00:00:00,,You're open.,artstream,578
00:00:00,,You're open.,artstream,579
00:00:00,,And I'll need blue for the eyes.,artstream,580
00:00:00,,I'll put it here first.,artstream,581
00:00:00,,"His mouth, inner mouth.",artstream,582
00:00:00,,I'll mix it all up.,artstream,583
00:00:00,,He has such a edge around the outside.,artstream,584
00:00:00,,You can expect it to be dry when you put very little diluted blue on it.,artstream,585
00:00:00,,I've already gone over it with blue once.,artstream,586
00:00:00,,Now already.,artstream,587
00:00:00,,"But fuck, I need a thinner pimple.",artstream,588
00:00:00,,I'm going to put it in.,artstream,589
00:00:00,,"It's going to be, kids, it's going to be.",artstream,590
00:00:00,,He knows the pimples.,artstream,591
00:00:00,,It looks like pimples.,artstream,592
00:00:00,,It looks like pimples.,artstream,593
00:00:00,,Pimples.,artstream,594
00:00:00,,Pimples.,artstream,595
00:00:00,,"So it's really going to be, I'm very surprised by myself.",artstream,596
00:00:00,,Look at it.,artstream,597
00:00:00,,He's not quite as shiny.,artstream,598
00:00:00,,He looks a little happier than the pimples I have as a template.,artstream,599
00:00:00,,"Good streamer, thank you, babies.",artstream,600
00:00:00,,Thank you.,artstream,601
00:00:00,,I have to...,artstream,602
00:00:00,,I hope I can make some mistakes with white here later.,artstream,603
00:00:00,,Where's the dog cam?,artstream,604
00:00:00,,I don't even know where...,artstream,605
00:00:00,,"Oh, no, Bimo is lying behind me.",artstream,606
00:00:00,,I don't have a second camera.,artstream,607

00:00:00,,And wimping.,artstream,917
00:00:00,,"So, where's my thinnest brush?",artstream,918
00:00:00,,Which one is it?,artstream,919
00:00:00,,This one.,artstream,920
00:00:00,,This one is completely f***ing black.,artstream,921
00:00:00,,But that's okay.,artstream,922
00:00:00,,That's okay too.,artstream,923
00:00:00,,We'll start with black.,artstream,924
00:00:00,,Oh my god.,artstream,925
00:00:00,,That's a black.,artstream,926
00:00:00,,That's a black.,artstream,927
00:00:00,,That's a black.,artstream,928
00:00:00,,That's a black.,artstream,929
00:00:00,,That's a black.,artstream,930
00:00:00,,That's a red.,artstream,931
00:00:00,,That's a red.,artstream,932
00:00:00,,The wimps are white.,artstream,933
00:00:00,,But I'm going to paint black here and then white over it.,artstream,934
00:00:00,,"But if it doesn't make sense, it will make sense, okay?",artstream,935
00:00:00,,I think.,artstream,936
00:00:00,,Maybe not.,artstream,937
00:00:00,,It's the first time I'm doing this.,artstream,938
00:00:00,,"The thing is, this...",artstream,939
00:00:00,,...sand-f***ing-little-shade here...,artstream,940
00:00:00,,...is also so f***ing bright.,artstream,941
00:00:00,,And I just want to see the wimps at the end.,artstream,942
00:00:00,,That's why we're doing a complete shit-over-the-ear-dirt.,artstream,943
00:00:00,,But it's okay.,artstream,944
00:00:00,,It's okay.,artstream,945
00:00:00,,It's really hard to paint right now.,artstream,946
00:00:00,,I'm going to do it with the black.,artstream,947
00:00:00,,I'm going to do it with the black.,artstream,948
00:00:00,,I'm going to do it with the black.,artstream,949
00:00:00,,I'm going to do it with the black.,artstream,950
00:00:00,,It's okay.,artstream,951
00:00:00,,"It's really hard right now, but...",artstream,952
00:00:00,,...not to shit-over-the-ear-dirt.,artstream,953
00:00:00,,Because this brush is too thick.,artstream,954
00:00:00,,I can't take out too many details.,artstream,955
00:00:00,,The lashes were made by me.,artstream,956
00:00:00,,"If you want to have such great lashes, ...sign up.",artstream,957
00:00:00,,Uni holiday on Instagram.,artstream,958
00:00:00,,Uni holiday on Instagram.,artstream,959
00:00:00,,Not really though.,artstream,960
00:00:00,,Bye.,artstream,961
00:00:00,,Don't let me get in your way.,artstream,962
00:00:00,,"Look at these crumpled shit-hands, Ando.",artstream,963
00:00:00,,That's a problem.,artstream,964
00:00:00,,But I don't think I can fix that.,artstream,965
00:00:00,,Tom's lashes in the stream.,artstream,966
00:00:00,,Tom's lashes in the stream.,artstream,967
00:00:00,,Tom's lashes in the stream.,artstream,968
00:00:00,,Gorgeous.,artstream,969
00:00:00,,Gorgeous.,artstream,970
00:00:00,,What did I think about this?,artstream,971
00:00:00,,What did I think about this?,artstream,972
00:00:00,,Why does he have five fingers?,artstream,973
00:00:00,,Why does he have five fingers?,artstream,974
00:00:00,,And two here.,artstream,975
00:00:00,,And two here.,artstream,976
00:00:00,,And two here.,artstream,977
00:00:00,,"But I have to say, ...this hand is so much better than this one.",artstream,978
00:00:00,,I'm going to fix that.,artstream,979
00:00:00,,I'm going to fix that.,artstream,980
00:00:00,,Like this.,artstream,981
00:00:00,,A little bit.,artstream,982
00:00:00,,I'm going to fix that.,artstream,983
00:00:00,,I'm going to fix that.,artstream,984
00:00:00,,...from shit.,artstream,985
00:00:00,,To make it even worse in the end.,artstream,986
00:00:00,,You can definitely tell it's from the spibbles.,artstream,987
00:00:00,,I'm going to fix that.,artstream,988
00:00:00,,I want fancy nails too.,artstream,989
00:00:00,,I want fancy nails too.,artstream,990
00:00:00,,Everything will be okay.,artstream,991
00:00:00,,I don't know.,artstream,992
00:00:00,,Have you seen my bibbles?,artstream,993
00:00:00,,Have you seen my desk mat?,artstream,994
00:00:00,,Have you seen my desk mat?,artstream,995
00:00:00,,"Well, the lady had fun in life, too bad for us.",artstream,996
00:00:00,,What is this supposed to be?,artstream,997
00:00:00,,Canceled.,artstream,998
00:00:00,,This is the wrong shit color.,artstream,999
00:00:00,,This is the wrong shit color.,artstream,1000
00:00:00,,This is the wrong shit color.,artstream,1001
00:00:00,,Sisi will hit us with the ultrasonic.,artstream,1002
00:00:00,,Sisi will hit us with the ultrasonic.,artstream,1003
00:00:00,,Suck it.,artstream,1004
00:00:00,,Okay.,artstream,1005
00:00:00,,Do it.,artstream,1006
00:00:00,,Do it how?,artstream,1007
00:00:00,,Try me.,artstream,1008
00:00:00,,"So, how do you make flames?",artstream,1009
00:00:00,,Boy.,artstream,1010
00:00:00,,He throws Sisi into the pool.,artstream,1011
00:00:00,,Nobody.,artstream,1012
00:00:00,,The pool stays closed.,artstream,1013
00:00:00,,Let's not do that.,artstream,1014
00:00:00,,Orange-red.,artstream,1015
00:00:00,,"That looks good, doesn't it?",artstream,1016
00:00:00,,That looks like a solid decision.,artstream,1017
00:00:00,,"I'll take this brush, which is already soaked in red.",artstream,1018
00:00:00,,"I'm really bad at cleaning brushes, so I just bought a new one instead of using Tom's and completely cleaning them.",artstream,1019
00:00:00,,"Come on, Max, Tom, a mi bibble is getting worse.",artstream,1020
00:00:00,,"Ah, we'll see.",artstream,1021
00:00:00,,I guess.,artstream,1022
00:00:00,,I'll just put you in one room.,artstream,1023
00:00:00,,It looks great.,artstream,1024
00:00:00,,Thank you.,artstream,1025
00:00:00,,I've been trying my best.,artstream,1026
00:00:00,,"Ah, I should have done the background earlier.",artstream,1027
00:00:00,,But...,artstream,1028
00:00:00,,Whatever.,artstream,1029
00:00:00,,We are still learning.,artstream,1030
00:00:00,,"Yeah, if he has a little flame in his face or in his ear, that's actually reasonable, isn't it?",artstream,1031
00:00:00,,Logical.,artstream,1032
00:00:00,,I'll start with everything here.,artstream,1033
00:00:00,,Orange-black.,artstream,1034
00:00:00,,"I'm really looking forward to the babies, yeah.",artstream,1035
00:00:00,,They are so cute.,artstream,1036
00:00:00,,Three out of four have opened their eyes.,artstream,1037
00:00:00,,So cute.,artstream,1038
00:00:00,,I'm really looking forward to the babies.,artstream,1039
00:00:00,,I don't have a system again.,artstream,1040
00:00:00,,Oh my god.,artstream,1041
00:00:00,,This time I wanted to make sure that the brush is in the right place.,artstream,1042
00:00:00,,"So I actually have a plan, but it doesn't look like it.",artstream,1043
00:00:00,,I'll just start the movie.,artstream,1044
00:00:00,,"Then we have Sisa and I, good bye.",artstream,1045
00:00:00,,Which movie?,artstream,1046
00:00:00,,K-Pop Demon Anthos?,artstream,1047
00:00:00,,What are you talking about?,artstream,1048
00:00:00,,"Wait, are you talking about...",artstream,1049
00:00:00,,"Yeah, wait a minute, Bush.",artstream,1050
00:00:00,,What is the status of your pool project?,artstream,1051
00:00:00,,Next year.,artstream,1052
00:00:00,,Okay.,artstream,1053
00:00:00,,Next year.,artstream,1054
00:00:00,,I'm already digging the hole.,artstream,1055
00:00:00,,These Wicks Sparco Huso gardeners still haven't reported properly.,artstream,1056
00:00:00,,What do you need the gardeners for?,artstream,1057
00:00:00,,Okay.,artstream,1058
00:00:00,,Yellow.,artstream,1059
00:00:00,,We need yellow.,artstream,1060
00:00:00,,Or orange-yellow.,artstream,1061
00:00:00,,Makes more sense.,artstream,1062
00:00:00,,I'll just call the company.,artstream,1063
00:00:00,,I'll call them really bad next week.,artstream,1064
00:00:00,,Grrr.,artstream,1065
00:00:00,,I'm sorry.,artstream,1066
00:00:00,,I'm sorry.,artstream,1067
00:00:00,,I'm sorry.,artstream,1068
00:00:00,,I'm sorry.,artstream,1069
00:00:00,,I'm sorry.,artstream,1070
00:00:00,,"No, I don't mean that.",artstream,1071
00:00:00,,We don't do that.,artstream,1072
00:00:00,,No.,artstream,1073
00:00:00,,Stop it.,artstream,1074
00:00:00,,I won't need the blue anymore.,artstream,1075
00:00:00,,That too.,artstream,1076
00:00:00,,That's just right.,artstream,1077
00:00:00,,Maybe this one.,artstream,1078
00:00:00,,This one can also be washed for now.,artstream,1079
00:00:00,,This one can also be washed for now.,artstream,1080
00:00:00,,We'll put the circle on the trash can.,artstream,1081
00:00:00,,Oh no.,artstream,1082
00:00:00,,Too much to clean up.,artstream,1083
00:00:00,,Or did you use really strong chemicals again?,artstream,1084
00:00:00,,Get some help.,artstream,1085
00:00:00,,Really?,artstream,1086
00:00:00,,Do you need help?,artstream,1087
00:00:00,,Do you need my help?,artstream,1088
00:00:00,,No.,artstream,1089
00:00:00,,"That's right, Tom.",artstream,1090
00:00:00,,Did you eat today?,artstream,1091
00:00:00,,"No, but the other one broke my back and I've had a headache for a week.",artstream,1092
00:00:00,,Oh no.,artstream,1093
00:00:00,,I'm sorry.,artstream,1094
00:00:00,,I'm just breathing in the paint.,artstream,1095
00:00:00,,That's great.,artstream,1096
00:00:00,,1h40?,artstream,1097
00:00:00,,That's really good.,artstream,1098
00:00:00,,"Good score, right?",artstream,1099
00:00:00,,I'm going to burn his shit-hand here.,artstream,1100
00:00:00,,And here too.,artstream,1101
00:00:00,,Burn.,artstream,1102
00:00:00,,Burn.,artstream,1103
00:00:00,,For breakfast I had three toasts.,artstream,1104
00:00:00,,"Okay, yes.",artstream,1105
00:00:00,,"That's right, I was there.",artstream,1106
00:00:00,,But what did you eat?,artstream,1107
00:00:00,,Puppercurva and liver casserole.,artstream,1108
00:00:00,,Okay.,artstream,1109
00:00:00,,"So, uh...",artstream,1110
00:00:00,,This is my finished product.,artstream,1111
00:00:00,,How would you rate it?,artstream,1112
00:00:00,,From 0 to 10?,artstream,1113
00:00:00,,I have to turn it like this so that it's actually...,artstream,1114
00:00:00,,His fucking wimpers.,artstream,1115
00:00:00,,It's beautiful.,artstream,1116
00:00:00,,He's beautiful.,artstream,1117
00:00:00,,Kinda.,artstream,1118
00:00:00,,Kinda not.,artstream,1119
00:00:00,,But it's already semi-ugly.,artstream,1120
00:00:00,,But we love him for that.,artstream,1121
00:00:00,,Oi.,artstream,1122
00:00:00,,Oi oi oi.,artstream,1123
00:00:00,,Wait a minute.,artstream,1124
00:00:00,,Perfect score.,artstream,1125
00:00:00,,5 out of 7.,artstream,1126
00:00:00,,Today he was up really early.,artstream,1127
00:00:00,,I was really surprised.,artstream,1128
00:00:00,,Where is my yellow pimple?,artstream,1129
00:00:00,,"Oh, this one.",artstream,1130
00:00:00,,I like that he's hand.,artstream,1131
00:00:00,,The flame comes out.,artstream,1132
00:00:00,,I'm not crying.,artstream,1133
00:00:00,,I'm waking up again.,artstream,1134
00:00:00,,That's crazy.,artstream,1135
00:00:00,,I had such a shitty dream today.,artstream,1136
00:00:00,,That I had a night out at Kai's.,artstream,1137
00:00:00,,And then he didn't want to set up his dining room.,artstream,1138
00:00:00,,"He was like, no, sorry, I didn't want to.",artstream,1139
00:00:00,,And then there was a body in it.,artstream,1140
00:00:00,,"Like, huh, Kai, what's up?",artstream,1141
00:00:00,,"Paradoxically, my body doesn't want to sleep through.",artstream,1142
00:00:00,,Yeah.,artstream,1143
00:00:00,,I'm not sure.,artstream,1144
00:00:00,,I'm not sure.,artstream,1145
00:00:00,,I don't want to start.,artstream,1146
00:00:00,,I'm Kai.,artstream,1147
00:00:00,,"Eyes closed, eyes open.",artstream,1148
00:00:00,,"What if you take my sleeping pills, Tom?",artstream,1149
00:00:00,,First we don't get the mattress and then this.,artstream,1150
00:00:00,,Yes.,artstream,1151
00:00:00,,"No, Kai has a dream mattress.",artstream,1152
00:00:00,,That's something else.,artstream,1153
00:00:00,,He has a dream mattress.,artstream,1154
00:00:00,,It's his Discord tag.,artstream,1155
00:00:00,,So I think that I rushed him a lot.,artstream,1156
00:00:00,,Is it okay?,artstream,1157
00:00:00,,Or?,artstream,1158
00:00:00,,I'm not sure.,artstream,1159
00:00:00,,I'm not sure.,artstream,1160
00:00:00,,Or?,artstream,1161
00:00:00,,I want to give it away now.,artstream,1162
00:00:00,,I don't know who wants it at all.,artstream,1163
00:00:00,,Honestly.,artstream,1164
00:00:00,,But I can start a giveaway.,artstream,1165
00:00:00,,Except at the end there's only one person who wants it anyway.,artstream,1166
00:00:00,,Then you just get the one person.,artstream,1167
00:00:00,,"Oh god, yes.",artstream,1168
00:00:00,,That's Bibels.,artstream,1169
00:00:00,,The legend.,artstream,1170
00:00:00,,"Yes, I love Bibels.",artstream,1171
00:00:00,,I had a girls night and we just watched Barbie Ferritopia.,artstream,1172
00:00:00,,"And that's why I was like okay, we have to be Bibels.",artstream,1173
00:00:00,,And my hands are now wonderfully dirty.,artstream,1174
00:00:00,,But yes.,artstream,1175
00:00:00,,Just Bibels.,artstream,1176
00:00:00,,The best.,artstream,1177
00:00:00,,I have a very short choice.,artstream,1178
00:00:00,,I would have sucked in too godlessly.,artstream,1179
00:00:00,,"Yes, I don't know what's wrong with me.",artstream,1180
00:00:00,,I just I didn't paint anything here.,artstream,1181
00:00:00,,So it's crazy.,artstream,1182
00:00:00,,Barbie movies were great.,artstream,1183
00:00:00,,So the old Barbie movies were great.,artstream,1184
00:00:00,,"The new Barbie movies are more like meh, except for the Razingan Niem.",artstream,1185
00:00:00,,When I find that ass funny.,artstream,1186
00:00:00,,But otherwise difficult.,artstream,1187
00:00:00,,But Barbie and the twelve sisters or something with this white-haired who is so ultra judgy is also really awesome.,artstream,1188
00:00:00,,And things with Swannensee.,artstream,1189
00:00:00,,"With this sassy prince, dude.",artstream,1190
00:00:00,,"Yes, exactly, Swannensee.",artstream,1191
00:00:00,,"Yes, so here is the final product for now.",artstream,1192
00:00:00,,Maybe I'll do something better.,artstream,1193
00:00:00,,It is of course not perfect.,artstream,1194
00:00:00,,"But it's the first time, okay?",artstream,1195
00:00:00,,It's the first time.,artstream,1196
00:00:00,,And it's the first time Bibel.,artstream,1197
00:00:00,,I'm okay with it.,artstream,1198
00:00:00,,A Looney original.,artstream,1199
00:00:00,,It's art.,artstream,1200
00:00:00,,Nussknacker was my first.,artstream,1201
00:00:00,,"I don't know what my first Barbie movie was, honestly.",artstream,1202
00:00:00,,And hello mortal.,artstream,1203
00:00:00,,Welcome.,artstream,1204
00:00:00,,Could be more yellow.,artstream,1205
00:00:00,,"Yes, the thing is the camera makes the colors a little different in my opinion.",artstream,1206
00:00:00,,"But I, yes.",artstream,1207
00:00:00,,You know what?,artstream,1208
00:00:00,,I'll put in a little more brighter yellow.,artstream,1209
00:00:00,,Just for you.,artstream,1210
00:00:00,,The tube is closed.,artstream,1211
00:00:00,,"So I think now it fits from the color pretty well, honestly.",artstream,1212
00:00:00,,From the Bibel's color at least.,artstream,1213
00:00:00,,That surprises me.,artstream,1214
00:00:00,,"Boy, now everything is in my hands.",artstream,1215
00:00:00,,I haven't sucked myself in all the time.,artstream,1216
00:00:00,,And now I'm sucking myself in all the time.,artstream,1217
00:00:00,,"But only myself, not my Desmet.",artstream,1218
00:00:00,,I'm very brave.,artstream,1219
00:00:00,,Yes.,artstream,1220
00:00:00,,"I was also, I thought it already.",artstream,1221
00:00:00,,I have to be careful otherwise I just swear.,artstream,1222
00:00:00,,I'll put in a little more brighter yellow.,artstream,1223
00:00:00,,"Yes, you know what?",artstream,1224
00:00:00,,"I I start in giveaway, okay?",artstream,1225

00:00:00,,I guess.,artstream,1317
00:00:00,,Ah!,artstream,1318
00:00:00,,Bro!,artstream,1319
00:00:00,,What is that?,artstream,1320

00:00:00,,It doesn't want to be used.,artstream,1322
00:00:00,,Okay.,artstream,1323

00:00:00,,I'm going to show you the final product.,artstream,1331
00:00:00,,I think that will be a little bit harder if you...,artstream,1332
00:00:00,,I have to draw hands and I can't draw hands.,artstream,1333
00:00:00,,You know?,artstream,1334

00:00:00,,That's too...,artstream,1344
00:00:00,,...shy?,artstream,1345
00:00:00,,This thing here needs to be more in this direction.,artstream,1346
00:00:00,,This head shape.,artstream,1347
00:00:00,,Head shape.,artstream,1348
00:00:00,,form.,artstream,1349
00:00:00,,It's a sweet pointed ear.,artstream,1350
00:00:00,,We're about to start.,artstream,1351
00:00:00,,"I would wait until minute 15, which means I'll be waiting for five minutes.",artstream,1352
00:00:00,,I'm going to do a sketch for the next picture.,artstream,1353
00:00:00,,Let's see how comfortable I feel with this sketch and whether I want to implement it right away.,artstream,1354
00:00:00,,Toes?,artstream,1355
00:00:00,,Why doesn't he have legs?,artstream,1356
00:00:00,,Bibis just doesn't have fucking legs.,artstream,1357
00:00:00,,Does he really have no legs?,artstream,1358
00:00:00,,He has legs!,artstream,1359
00:00:00,,Where are they?,artstream,1360
00:00:00,,They were just erased.,artstream,1361
00:00:00,,I don't know.,artstream,1362
00:00:00,,They were just erased.,artstream,1363
00:00:00,,I'm going to give him legs.,artstream,1364
00:00:00,,That's the wrong picture.,artstream,1365
00:00:00,,Maybe.,artstream,1366
00:00:00,,Then he has a wing here.,artstream,1367
00:00:00,,Now you can only see one.,artstream,1368
00:00:00,,Nobody knows.,artstream,1369
00:00:00,,The wing is too So that fits.,artstream,1370
00:00:00,,It has to be the same here.,artstream,1371
00:00:00,,But here he's not fat enough.,artstream,1372
00:00:00,,This is where here's one arm.,artstream,1373
00:00:00,,"Boy, Bibis is so unfit.",artstream,1374
00:00:00,,He's not going to do it.,artstream,1375
00:00:00,,He's going to keep going.,artstream,1376
00:00:00,,He's going to keep going.,artstream,1377
00:00:00,,And the other arm.,artstream,1378
00:00:00,,That's the right one.,artstream,1379
00:00:00,,But I don't know how to do it.,artstream,1380
00:00:00,,It's going to be a bad picture.,artstream,1381
00:00:00,,It's going to be a bad picture.,artstream,1382
00:00:00,,I don't know.,artstream,1383
00:00:00,,I'm going to try.,artstream,1384
00:00:00,,I'm going to try.,artstream,1385
00:00:00,,I'm going to try.,artstream,1386
00:00:00,,I'm going to try.,artstream,1387
00:00:00,,I will now be the drawing master of Bibble.,artstream,1388
00:00:00,,Bibble speed drawing master.,artstream,1389
00:00:00,,But if he flies...,artstream,1390
00:00:00,,What are his...,artstream,1391
00:00:00,,"It's time, okay.",artstream,1392
00:00:00,,Close the broadcast.,artstream,1393
00:00:00,,I'll go to live scene.,artstream,1394
00:00:00,,"Winner, investigate.",artstream,1395

00:00:00,,Hello?,artstream,1397
00:00:00,,Hello?,artstream,1398
00:00:00,,Do I have to wait 60 minutes?,artstream,1399

00:00:00,,Congrats Kai.,artstream,1405
00:00:00,,Kai won!,artstream,1406
00:00:00,,Wait.,artstream,1407
00:00:00,,Then Kai will get the...,artstream,1408
00:00:00,,...summer party.,artstream,1409
00:00:00,,Call it.,artstream,1410
00:00:00,,I also expected that.,artstream,1411
00:00:00,,I honestly also expected that Kai will get the picture.,artstream,1412
00:00:00,,I won!,artstream,1413
00:00:00,,"Yes, you won!",artstream,1414
00:00:00,,How do his legs look when he flies?,artstream,1415
00:00:00,,Kai always wins.,artstream,1416
00:00:00,,Everything.,artstream,1417
00:00:00,,Basically.,artstream,1418
00:00:00,,His legs look like this.,artstream,1419
00:00:00,,Why is the quality of this picture so good?,artstream,1420
00:00:00,,"No, he's looking!",artstream,1421
00:00:00,,F**ker!,artstream,1422
00:00:00,,Motherf**ker!,artstream,1423
00:00:00,,What?,artstream,1424
00:00:00,,Do you want a Cigar pudding?,artstream,1425
00:00:00,,Eww.,artstream,1426
00:00:00,,I also have mosquito nets.,artstream,1427
00:00:00,,But sometimes something still comes through.,artstream,1428
00:00:00,,That's the problem.,artstream,1429
00:00:00,,That's my f**king problem.,artstream,1430
00:00:00,,And this is just...,artstream,1431
00:00:00,,This is completely wrong.,artstream,1432
00:00:00,,This eye.,artstream,1433
00:00:00,,This has to go up.,artstream,1434
00:00:00,,I'm sorry.,artstream,1435
00:00:00,,Max poked it so well on me.,artstream,1436
00:00:00,,Maxi.,artstream,1437
00:00:00,,"Yes, that wasn't a problem at all.",artstream,1438
00:00:00,,I made it really stupid at the beginning.,artstream,1439
00:00:00,,And somehow I stuck this thesis that you need really bad.,artstream,1440
00:00:00,,Totally...,artstream,1441
00:00:00,,...not really thought out.,artstream,1442
00:00:00,,Somehow.,artstream,1443
00:00:00,,But...,artstream,1444
00:00:00,,...finally it worked out.,artstream,1445
00:00:00,,I have a mosquito net in every room except in the bathroom.,artstream,1446
00:00:00,,Actually.,artstream,1447
00:00:00,,Because I think that the mosquito net gives way worse air.,artstream,1448
00:00:00,,And I just need air in the bathroom.,artstream,1449
00:00:00,,You know?,artstream,1450
00:00:00,,"Kinda makes sense, doesn't it?",artstream,1451
00:00:00,,I'm sorry.,artstream,1452
00:00:00,,"So, okay.",artstream,1453
00:00:00,,I have...,artstream,1454
00:00:00,,The sketch is done.,artstream,1455
00:00:00,,Or not done.,artstream,1456
00:00:00,,I have to edit it because one eye is wrong.,artstream,1457
00:00:00,,This one.,artstream,1458
00:00:00,,Or this one.,artstream,1459
00:00:00,,I have to decide which eye I think is wrong.,artstream,1460
00:00:00,,His nose is somehow a little wider.,artstream,1461
00:00:00,,And a little...,artstream,1462
00:00:00,,But sketches...,artstream,1463
00:00:00,,I can sketch pretty quickly.,artstream,1464
00:00:00,,Or just draw it.,artstream,1465
00:00:00,,I can definitely improve some things with the eraser.,artstream,1466
00:00:00,,I don't like the position of the eye.,artstream,1467
00:00:00,,I have to bring that out a little.,artstream,1468
00:00:00,,But then we know which picture we want to draw next.,artstream,1469
00:00:00,,And that's the final result of today's stream.,artstream,1470
00:00:00,,I don't want to mess up the picture here.,artstream,1471
00:00:00,,For Kai!,artstream,1472
00:00:00,,So.,artstream,1473
00:00:00,,"I used a lot of colors, after all.",artstream,1474
00:00:00,,My brushes.,artstream,1475
00:00:00,,I have to clean that.,artstream,1476
00:00:00,,My 1000 pencils.,artstream,1477
00:00:00,,Yahoo!,artstream,1478
00:00:00,,I have to fix the camera here.,artstream,1479
00:00:00,,Oopsie.,artstream,1480
00:00:00,,I didn't fix it.,artstream,1481
00:00:00,,I'll make it a little darker.,artstream,1482
00:00:00,,So.,artstream,1483
00:00:00,,Hello.,artstream,1484
00:00:00,,So.,artstream,1485
00:00:00,,That was...,artstream,1486
00:00:00,,...not bad at all.,artstream,1487
00:00:00,,Not bad at all.,artstream,1488
00:00:00,,Now a little more light.,artstream,1489
00:00:00,,A little further away.,artstream,1490
00:00:00,,You can also leave it to work.,artstream,1491
00:00:00,,It's a 2020 thing.,artstream,1492
00:00:00,,You're watching the summer party anyway.,artstream,1493
00:00:00,,"Not all of you, but those I see live tomorrow.",artstream,1494
00:00:00,,You can watch it live.,artstream,1495
00:00:00,,It's almost dry.,artstream,1496
00:00:00,,It's just a Looney original.,artstream,1497
00:00:00,,You have to be able to afford it.,artstream,1498
00:00:00,,It cost a lot of money.,artstream,1499
00:00:00,,No.,artstream,1500
00:00:00,,Big shout out to Niklas.,artstream,1501
00:00:00,,That he made the subgoal.,artstream,1502
00:00:00,,We'll do it again next month.,artstream,1503
00:00:00,,I just do a...,artstream,1504
00:00:00,,I just do a...,artstream,1505
00:00:00,,I'll do another subgoal.,artstream,1506
00:00:00,,And then we'll do a 12 hour stream in August.,artstream,1507
00:00:00,,With the painting.,artstream,1508
00:00:00,,We'll do that in August.,artstream,1509
00:00:00,,I just want to...,artstream,1510
00:00:00,,We have this with these discounted shares.,artstream,1511
00:00:00,,I'll do that now.,artstream,1512
00:00:00,,Every month in one of the streams.,artstream,1513
00:00:00,,Then it costs 5...,artstream,1514
00:00:00,,Gifties is somehow 15 euros.,artstream,1515
00:00:00,,You have to go over 12 bridge pictures.,artstream,1516
00:00:00,,The next picture will be a bridge picture.,artstream,1517
00:00:00,,"No, the next picture will be this one.",artstream,1518
00:00:00,,Well.,artstream,1519
00:00:00,,It's art.,artstream,1520
00:00:00,,The perspective is a bit weird.,artstream,1521
00:00:00,,But it's okay.,artstream,1522
00:00:00,,Summer party.,artstream,1523
00:00:00,,I do it every year.,artstream,1524
00:00:00,,At my parents' house.,artstream,1525

00:00:00,,They go on vacation for a few days.,artstream,1531
00:00:00,,While I'm doing party-hardy.,artstream,1532
00:00:00,,"No, it's not a party.",artstream,1533
00:00:00,,But just a get together.,artstream,1534
00:00:00,,It's not my birthday or anything.,artstream,1535
00:00:00,,I don't really want to celebrate my birthday.,artstream,1536
00:00:00,,But just a summer party.,artstream,1537
00:00:00,,Next year it will be here.,artstream,1538
00:00:00,,It can happen here.,artstream,1539
00:00:00,,Depending on how it goes.,artstream,1540
00:00:00,,I will see a lot of you from the chat.,artstream,1541
00:00:00,,I'm really looking forward to it.,artstream,1542
00:00:00,,A lot of people are coming by.,artstream,1543
00:00:00,,My first one!,artstream,1544
00:00:00,,This is the...,artstream,1545
00:00:00,,3rd or 4th summer party in a row.,artstream,1546
00:00:00,,Every year in August there is a party.,artstream,1547
00:00:00,,It's always a little highlight.,artstream,1548
00:00:00,,It's super stressful.,artstream,1549
00:00:00,,But...,artstream,1550
00:00:00,,I'm not invited.,artstream,1551
00:00:00,,I understand.,artstream,1552
00:00:00,,"Yes, I will do a Twitch summer party.",artstream,1553
00:00:00,,In a public place.,artstream,1554
00:00:00,,No.,artstream,1555
00:00:00,,Actually it would be cool.,artstream,1556
00:00:00,,A community party.,artstream,1557
00:00:00,,But it's super hard to implement.,artstream,1558
00:00:00,,And super expensive.,artstream,1559
00:00:00,,"If so, I would rather say we all go out to eat together.",artstream,1560
00:00:00,,When everyone is at the Gamescom.,artstream,1561
00:00:00,,That would be cool.,artstream,1562
00:00:00,,But let's see.,artstream,1563
00:00:00,,Let's see.,artstream,1564
00:00:00,,"Well, I can...",artstream,1565
00:00:00,,I wanted to talk to Zizi about Gamescom.,artstream,1566
00:00:00,,And Sofia might go to Gamescom professionally.,artstream,1567
00:00:00,,I don't know.,artstream,1568
00:00:00,,I don't know.,artstream,1569
00:00:00,,Let's see.,artstream,1570
00:00:00,,Actually I would like to do cosplay.,artstream,1571
00:00:00,,But I don't have time for that.,artstream,1572
00:00:00,,Unfortunately.,artstream,1573
00:00:00,,"Sofia, everything is super spontaneous.",artstream,1574
00:00:00,,No shit.,artstream,1575
00:00:00,,It's so weird.,artstream,1576
00:00:00,,The fans are actually finding my background.,artstream,1577
00:00:00,,I have a sunset lamp here.,artstream,1578
00:00:00,,And somehow it looks super nice on the camera.,artstream,1579
00:00:00,,I only come to Gamescom for the ARD-stand.,artstream,1580
00:00:00,,Huh?,artstream,1581
00:00:00,,"Bush, you're not a Gamescom-gear anyway, right?",artstream,1582
00:00:00,,Very fancy.,artstream,1583
00:00:00,,"Yes, yes.",artstream,1584
00:00:00,,I actually want to do something with my Alexa.,artstream,1585
00:00:00,,So I can go to streaming mode and turn all the lights on.,artstream,1586
00:00:00,,And I ordered this mirror twice.,artstream,1587
00:00:00,,And one of them is completely broken into a thousand pieces.,artstream,1588
00:00:00,,Already arrived.,artstream,1589
00:00:00,,And now I have to send it back.,artstream,1590
00:00:00,,From the line-up.,artstream,1591
00:00:00,,"Yes, okay.",artstream,1592
00:00:00,,I don't know what's coming yet.,artstream,1593
00:00:00,,Actually...,artstream,1594
00:00:00,,"There will be a Witcher 4-stand, right?",artstream,1595
00:00:00,,I don't even have to inform myself.,artstream,1596
00:00:00,,I would like to go with...,artstream,1597
00:00:00,,...with Tom.,artstream,1598
00:00:00,,But we don't have a place to stay.,artstream,1599
00:00:00,,I'll see.,artstream,1600
00:00:00,,So I'll start Discord.,artstream,1601
00:00:00,,It takes...,artstream,1602
00:00:00,,"No Witcher, what the fuck?",artstream,1603
00:00:00,,Dude!,artstream,1604
00:00:00,,"Boy, Kai!",artstream,1605
00:00:00,,That almost scares me.,artstream,1606
00:00:00,,Look at Kai's bib!,artstream,1607
00:00:00,,So...,artstream,1608
00:00:00,,Mine is better.,artstream,1609
00:00:00,,Did you just draw it in paint yourself?,artstream,1610
00:00:00,,Or what's going on here?,artstream,1611
00:00:00,,What's going on here?,artstream,1612
00:00:00,,"Oh my god, oh my god.",artstream,1613
00:00:00,,I zoomed into this picture.,artstream,1614
00:00:00,,That's horrible!,artstream,1615
00:00:00,,"That's very, very bad!",artstream,1616
00:00:00,,Yesterday...,artstream,1617
00:00:00,,You quickly painted it yesterday.,artstream,1618
00:00:00,,I quickly painted it yesterday.,artstream,1619
00:00:00,,Just my inner self.,artstream,1620
00:00:00,,That's what Bibbel's inner self looks like.,artstream,1621
00:00:00,,I'm going to pack some things for tomorrow.,artstream,1622
00:00:00,,"Okay, good night, Ti, sleep well.",artstream,1623
00:00:00,,"No, that's fine.",artstream,1624
00:00:00,,"Those who are already leaving, that's okay.",artstream,1625
00:00:00,,Anyone who can take a blanket with them...,artstream,1626
00:00:00,,"I'm happy to take a blanket with me, because I don't think I have enough.",artstream,1627
00:00:00,,I definitely don't have enough blankets.,artstream,1628
00:00:00,,"Thank you for your follow, nice that you're here.",artstream,1629
00:00:00,,I haven't done a talk stream for a long time.,artstream,1630
00:00:00,,"Well, there was a lot of painting here.",artstream,1631
00:00:00,,"I have to get rid of it now, because I'm afraid it will shift on my desk mat.",artstream,1632
00:00:00,,And I don't want that.,artstream,1633
00:00:00,,"I would have a press pass for Friday for the Gamescom, but no accommodation.",artstream,1634
00:00:00,,I think I just don't have enough for the master's.,artstream,1635
00:00:00,,I understand.,artstream,1636
00:00:00,,It's the same for me.,artstream,1637
00:00:00,,That's why I would rather do it spontaneously with the Gamescom.,artstream,1638
00:00:00,,I'm going to work really hard on the master's next week.,artstream,1639
00:00:00,,"Because I know that if I really get into it, I can do a lot in a very short time.",artstream,1640
00:00:00,,"But yes, I'm procrastinating too hard.",artstream,1641
00:00:00,,I'm only there on Saturday and Sunday.,artstream,1642
00:00:00,,I'm only there on Friday and Sunday.,artstream,1643
00:00:00,,"Yes, I wanted to talk about the master's, but I can only do that next week when I really get into it.",artstream,1644
00:00:00,,And have a little more overview.,artstream,1645
00:00:00,,I think I need a little opinion.,artstream,1646
00:00:00,,I have to look at what I've written so far and read through it again.,artstream,1647
00:00:00,,"Because somehow, I don't know.",artstream,1648
00:00:00,,I'm going to look at what I have to give up.,artstream,1649
00:00:00,,"No, no.",artstream,1650
00:00:00,,"Thank you, Tom.",artstream,1651
00:00:00,,"T3, just.",artstream,1652
00:00:00,,Thank you very much for all the subs that come in.,artstream,1653
00:00:00,,You are cute.,artstream,1654
00:00:00,,You are absolutely cute.,artstream,1655
00:00:00,,I'm out for today.,artstream,1656
00:00:00,,"All right, I'm not there for that long either.",artstream,1657
00:00:00,,I started earlier to stop earlier.,artstream,1658
00:00:00,,How do I want to play something together?,artstream,1659
00:00:00,,I'll just message you.,artstream,1660
00:00:00,,"Yes, I'm still thinking about whether I should do a study or a survey.",artstream,1661
00:00:00,,Maybe you have good input on what you think is better.,artstream,1662
00:00:00,,"And generally, I can imagine that you have good input on what the subject is.",artstream,1663
00:00:00,,"If I wouldn't talk so stupidly and write even worse, then it would be okay.",artstream,1664
00:00:00,,"Yes, I'm trying to make a chatbot of myself.",artstream,1665
00:00:00,,And use these Twitch VODs where I also go into the messages and so on.,artstream,1666
00:00:00,,So that he learns a little how I express myself.,artstream,1667
00:00:00,,"Then prompting, hardcoding with certain rules.",artstream,1668
00:00:00,,And then I either want to do a study where people use it.,artstream,1669
00:00:00,,But then I have to think about which questions I ask that it is not too subjective at the end.,artstream,1670
00:00:00,,So from me it is subjective.,artstream,1671
00:00:00,,I just have to formulate objective questions and that's a bit of a problem.,artstream,1672
00:00:00,,Or whether I generally ask how people feel about it in different generations.,artstream,1673
00:00:00,,I can go into the subject and say I'm asking people who actually know me.,artstream,1674
00:00:00,,And who then make their impression.,artstream,1675
00:00:00,,"Yes, exactly.",artstream,1676
00:00:00,,"Yes, right.",artstream,1677
00:00:00,,I just have to look.,artstream,1678
00:00:00,,I would like to have different grades of people who know me.,artstream,1679
00:00:00,,I know myself here people.,artstream,1680
00:00:00,,"You can now, for example, about Twitch.",artstream,1681
00:00:00,,How I express myself on Twitch and so on.,artstream,1682
00:00:00,,And the chatbot will be very interesting.,artstream,1683
00:00:00,,But my mother knows me differently.,artstream,1684
00:00:00,,Sophia knows me differently.,artstream,1685
00:00:00,,Tom knows me differently than my partner.,artstream,1686
00:00:00,,There are different levels of relationships.,artstream,1687
00:00:00,,And then you can still get good input from people how they feel.,artstream,1688
00:00:00,,Whether it is too shallow for them.,artstream,1689
00:00:00,,Whether it suits them.,artstream,1690
00:00:00,,Whether they are surprised how well he can depict me.,artstream,1691
00:00:00,,Because they are very good at it.,artstream,1692
00:00:00,,And then I can also say that I am very good at it.,artstream,1693
00:00:00,,I can also say that I am very good at it.,artstream,1694
00:00:00,,I can also say that I am very good at it.,artstream,1695
00:00:00,,Whether it suits them.,artstream,1696
00:00:00,,Whether they are surprised how well he can depict me.,artstream,1697
00:00:00,,Because they may not know me so well.,artstream,1698
00:00:00,,And how they might approach me beforehand.,artstream,1699
00:00:00,,And how they might approach me beforehand.,artstream,1700
00:00:00,,That's just difficult.,artstream,1701
00:00:00,,"Yes, exactly.",artstream,1702
00:00:00,,"Yes, I just have to look.",artstream,1703
00:00:00,,It's just good to know.,artstream,1704
00:00:00,,"It's just like my partner, my family, my best friends.",artstream,1705
00:00:00,,"It's just like my partner, my family, my best friends.",artstream,1706
00:00:00,,It's private to know.,artstream,1707
00:00:00,,While Twitch is just social media.,artstream,1708
00:00:00,,I am waiting for the first Looneybot date.,artstream,1709
00:00:00,,I will admit that he must not be romantically engaged.,artstream,1710
00:00:00,,I will admit that he must not be romantically engaged.,artstream,1711
00:00:00,,I will admit that he must not be romantically engaged.,artstream,1712
00:00:00,,Let's not do that.,artstream,1713
00:00:00,,And no image generation here.,artstream,1714
00:00:00,,And no image generation here.,artstream,1715
00:00:00,,My voice was already stolen to call my mother that I had a car accident.,artstream,1716
00:00:00,,My voice was already stolen to call my mother that I had a car accident.,artstream,1717
00:00:00,,"She called me while I was sitting at the table and my passport, the documents, just went through my hand.",artstream,1718
00:00:00,,"And my passport, the documents, just went through my hand.",artstream,1719
00:00:00,,The lady who gave me the documents to sign.,artstream,1720
00:00:00,,I was sitting in the office.,artstream,1721
00:00:00,,"She wrote to me, yes, you had such an accident.",artstream,1722
00:00:00,,"I was like, no, I'm sitting in the citizen's office.",artstream,1723
00:00:00,,"I was like, no, I'm sitting in the citizen's office.",artstream,1724
00:00:00,,What's going on?,artstream,1725
00:00:00,,As if I would call you a misprinted number.,artstream,1726
00:00:00,,As if I would call you a misprinted number.,artstream,1727
00:00:00,,"And then my mother said, And then my mother said, She was not sure, because she was already trusting me that I would overtake a pregnant woman.",artstream,1728
00:00:00,,And that she would die.,artstream,1729
00:00:00,,Because I was driving over a red light.,artstream,1730
00:00:00,,And I wouldn't have it with 5 kmh.,artstream,1731
00:00:00,,And I wouldn't have it with 5 kmh.,artstream,1732
00:00:00,,I would have been driving over the light at 50 kmh.,artstream,1733
00:00:00,,"My last car accident was on the highway, in a traffic jam, at 10 kmh, because I pulled out, because I thought, a truck pulled out too, right behind me, and I thought, if a truck has space, I have space too.",artstream,1734
00:00:00,,"Stupid logic, I know, stupid logic.",artstream,1735
00:00:00,,"The truck could still brake, it saw more.",artstream,1736
00:00:00,,I just didn't.,artstream,1737
00:00:00,,"Then we are together, I at a brand new BMW with fucking 10 kmh.",artstream,1738
00:00:00,,I drove this BMW on the dirt that was on the front of my car.,artstream,1739
00:00:00,,There was not even a scratch.,artstream,1740
00:00:00,,That was literally just dirt that I drove on it.,artstream,1741
00:00:00,,That was just nothing.,artstream,1742
00:00:00,,That was my last car accident.,artstream,1743
00:00:00,,"My first car accident, I only had two.",artstream,1744
00:00:00,,My other car accident was that I was standing on the mountain and was rolling back very slowly.,artstream,1745
00:00:00,,That was such a mountain.,artstream,1746
00:00:00,,I didn't roll back quickly.,artstream,1747
00:00:00,,Then I docked to the car with my trailer clutch.,artstream,1748
00:00:00,,"It didn't hurt, nothing.",artstream,1749
00:00:00,,But I got a warning because of the air traffic.,artstream,1750
00:00:00,,Did she say something good today?,artstream,1751
00:00:00,,I...,artstream,1752
00:00:00,,I don't know.,artstream,1753
00:00:00,,She definitely said that she also had a shield under function.,artstream,1754
00:00:00,,And at the beginning she was super smart.,artstream,1755
00:00:00,,At the beginning she had to take very strong pills.,artstream,1756
00:00:00,,Because it was really bad for her.,artstream,1757
00:00:00,,And she found out that she had 15.,artstream,1758
00:00:00,,"And the thing is, I was in the hospital once because of a kidney colleague.",artstream,1759
00:00:00,,And then I was told that maybe she had a shield under function.,artstream,1760
00:00:00,,"I was like, no, I don't think so.",artstream,1761
00:00:00,,I'm also very under important.,artstream,1762
00:00:00,,I don't know what to say.,artstream,1763
00:00:00,,But my blood values were already there.,artstream,1764
00:00:00,,That the nurse said that I had a shield under function.,artstream,1765
00:00:00,,And I didn't take it seriously.,artstream,1766
00:00:00,,But I didn't have many symptoms.,artstream,1767
00:00:00,,That's why I guess it's not always a challenge for me.,artstream,1768
00:00:00,,I actually have a shield under function and it's getting worse because she's not treated.,artstream,1769
00:00:00,,Loony's mom saying something nice challenge.,artstream,1770
00:00:00,,"Yeah, we'll invite her to a livestream and then we'll wait until she says something nice.",artstream,1771
00:00:00,,It's not gonna happen.,artstream,1772
00:00:00,,More hitting.,artstream,1773
00:00:00,,What do you mean?,artstream,1774
00:00:00,,What parking picture do you have to think of?,artstream,1775
00:00:00,,"Why do you dare to do that to me, Bush?",artstream,1776
00:00:00,,To drive over a red traffic light?,artstream,1777
00:00:00,,"I'm not under important, kid.",artstream,1778
00:00:00,,I have a normal weight.,artstream,1779
00:00:00,,It's okay.,artstream,1780
00:00:00,,Where you parked so tight.,artstream,1781
00:00:00,,That wasn't me!,artstream,1782
00:00:00,,"I parked, went in, paid, came out and some kind of stupid guy drove against my car while parking and was standing next to my car.",artstream,1783
00:00:00,,He was docked and then just got out and pissed himself off.,artstream,1784
00:00:00,,That wasn't me!,artstream,1785
00:00:00,,I parked and there was nobody in front of me.,artstream,1786
00:00:00,,It wasn't me!,artstream,1787
00:00:00,,That was also a...,artstream,1788
00:00:00,,I don't know what I'm gonna do now.,artstream,1789
00:00:00,,I'm gonna wait for the guy.,artstream,1790
00:00:00,,He can have a huge shopping and can only come in two hours.,artstream,1791
00:00:00,,Yeah.,artstream,1792
00:00:00,,It really wasn't me.,artstream,1793
00:00:00,,People told me I think he drove against your car when I came back.,artstream,1794
00:00:00,,"I was like, bro, what?",artstream,1795
00:00:00,,I went into the shopping district and bought two things.,artstream,1796
00:00:00,,"I wasn't in the shopping district, I was in the shop.",artstream,1797
00:00:00,,Shopping district!,artstream,1798
00:00:00,,I was in there for five minutes.,artstream,1799
00:00:00,,Pump.,artstream,1800
00:00:00,,Pump.,artstream,1801
00:00:00,,What a jerk.,artstream,1802
00:00:00,,A lack of ice because the pill was forgotten and the red traffic light is green.,artstream,1803
00:00:00,,No.,artstream,1804
00:00:00,,No.,artstream,1805
00:00:00,,So that I overtake people on purpose.,artstream,1806
00:00:00,,No.,artstream,1807
00:00:00,,Not really.,artstream,1808
00:00:00,,Or I don't know because I have to avoid another car or something.,artstream,1809
00:00:00,,But normally when I build accidents they're just really stupid.,artstream,1810
00:00:00,,Really stupid with 5 km per hour.,artstream,1811
00:00:00,,Like the best friend of my cousin who drove a scooter at 10 km per hour.,artstream,1812
00:00:00,,And then he drove so slowly that the scooter just flipped over.,artstream,1813
00:00:00,,He lay down on the wall and just broke himself in the elbow.,artstream,1814
00:00:00,,"No, no, she didn't say she was afraid of me, but that I overtake people.",artstream,1815
00:00:00,,Sometimes you're also completely through each other and then you just drive over a red traffic light.,artstream,1816
00:00:00,,"I was like, bro.",artstream,1817
00:00:00,,When did you notice that I drove over a red traffic light?,artstream,1818
00:00:00,,"You never drove with me, lady.",artstream,1819
00:00:00,,I've never been blinded by a red traffic light or something.,artstream,1820
00:00:00,,I was blinded the last time seven years ago.,artstream,1821
00:00:00,,Well.,artstream,1822
