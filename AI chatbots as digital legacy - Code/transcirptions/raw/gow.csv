00:00:00,,hello peoples na wie war euer Wochenende?,gow,1
00:00:00,,"dafür Kai, dass du gute Suppe hast gut Suppe is du, bist du so jemand der immer das gleiche isst oder dann schon oder ständig durchwechselt weißt du wie ich mein?",gow,2
00:00:00,,"so Sophia vier Monate durchs gleiche essen jeden Tag oder ne ich bin so im Mittelweg glaube ich ich weiß nicht wer von uns jeden Tag was anderes essen muss oder möchte mein Vater der möchte jeden Tag was anderes haben der mag das nicht wenn es ständig Reste essen gibt das macht ihn, das macht ihn depri und hallo Flo ich war gerade noch mit Tom in Somboldt und habe mich um unsere landwirtschaftlichen Dings scheiß gekümmert hatte meine letzte Fertigsuppe vor zwei Monaten ja ok, dann bist du auch mehr so Team mein Dad ja also ich esse halt, ich bin eher so jemand der drei Mal in der Woche das gleiche essen kann aber halt nicht jeden ich hintereinander die ganze Zeit aber drei Mal in der Woche und das ist monatlang für mich fein so keine Ahnung, schmiere ich mir halt immer genau das gleiche Brot oder ich mache mir halt ständig mein scheiß Kimchi Ramen oder meine Spicy Cheese Nudels weißt du wie ich mein?",gow,3
00:00:00,,"aber ich brauche halt dann am nächsten Tag was anderes und am übernächsten könnte ich es wieder essen so bin ich eher ja mein Bruder ist auch so jemand der das jeden Tag was anderes will ich habe gestern so eine süße Postkarte bekommen von meiner Nichte die war so hype dass Tom und ich gekommen sind und dann haben wir einfach nicht mit ihr, wie heißt es, Ghosts gespielt wir haben die ganze Zeit mit Biss Mut mit so einem Metall rumgespielt das geschmolzen weil wir Biss Mut Kristalle machen wollten hat super, ja am Anfang gar nicht funktioniert und dann irgendwann schon aber nicht gut genug, also da geht noch was jeden Tag Reis mit irgendeinem Pesto, du isst Reis mit Pesto?",gow,4
00:00:00,,"das isst man auch mit Nudeln ja du hast hier nicht ihr Sonnensystem angeguckt, wir haben nicht mit ihr Ghosts gespielt ich bin aber eine Weile mit ihr im Lagerfeuer gesessen weil wir haben dann Stockbrot und Marshmallows gemacht und dann ich glaube da war sie schon happy sie habe mich dann auch gefragt wie ich das immer mache mit den Strichen an meinem Auge und warum die schwarz sein müssen und nicht bunt weil ich habe dann auch gesagt ja ich habe auch ganz viele bunte Farben aber die benutze ich nicht so oft nicht immer bunt schwarz ist schöner, ok?",gow,5
00:00:00,,ich mag schwarz mehr Essen ist Essen?,gow,6
00:00:00,,"ja gut, aber ich habe bei dir Flo schon das Gefühl dass du da schon eher ein bisschen picky bist was Essen angeht, also du bist sehr schnell unzufrieden mit Essen dass du da ein Reis mit Pesto frisst wundert mich, ist günstig aber da sind noch Nudeln irgendwie irgendwie nicer so immer wenn wir zu essen, also wirklich immer wenn wir was zu essen bestellen beschwert sich Flo über irgendwas, irgendwas ist immer falsch der Döner letztens war auch nicht richtig, es ist immer irgendwas schlecht du isst alles aber du isst nichts gern ich habe die Suppe zu scharf gemacht dann nicht zu tief rein schlürfen sonst hast du es im Rachen hängen ich habe vorher einfach diese Mauernkrache die hatte ich das letzte Mal bestimmt vor 10 Jahren ich habe einfach einen inhaliert kurz und mich ultra dran verschluckt und die sind ja dann, die sind ja so fest, das heißt die cutten dann erstmal richtig rein und tun einfach arschwebe wenn die in deinem Hals drin stecken but I survived, I'm still here just done happy although I'm a little bit on edge today also because of the elections and I don't know why but next week there will be a lot of important stuff and a lot of things where I don't know how it will go and if it will all go as I want it to I don't know things that I can't estimate 100% and where I shouldn't worry about I'm sorry because it will come when it will but of course I'm still worried because it's me but Linke has almost 9% how it looks, we don't know for sure I ate a whole pack and then fell backwards after the ping-pong huh?",gow,7
00:00:00,,huh?,gow,8
00:00:00,,a whole pack and crash or what?,gow,9
00:00:00,,what are you talking about?,gow,10
00:00:00,,"and I'm really happy too the green ones would have liked to have a little more of the AfD so they could graze yes, CDU-CSU a little bit but the AfD is very obvious 20% is already heavy oh, I was blank and then bam maybe wall crashes are too toxic maybe it is there is some kind of crap in there that sounds like shit brown powder in the filling, partly cola flavor it says there really big, as if it were a warning cola flavor is already terrible moisture-resistant sugar I think you're because of the bee wax that makes it so colorful that makes the edges that's why you're so powerful, Kai so I think of the four I have the most okay with that I would be fine but Kai would be really cool Merz, Scholz and Weidel really not Habeck I think Habeck has potential I think he has learned a lot in the last four years and has potential that he changes well so with that I would be fine I also like him he seems not so inaudible exactly, he is very down to earth and is informed he also talked facts during the facts checks and I think he seems much more competent than the others more competent and sympathetic.",gow,11
00:00:00,,"I think he is more competent than the others more competent and sympathetic although I can't say anything about Scholz except that I think he is partly like a little child because I just didn't notice anything from him I don't know I don't know what he did in the last four years I don't know I don't know where he was I don't know what he did I don't know what he did Scholz was not present for me he was not present in my world I always forgot that he is the chancellor for real I just forgot I was always surprised and I was like, oh yeah, right oh yeah although I have to say that's not good for me I think I am politically informed I have a little bit of an idea but not enough I get things when people talk about it but I am not always actively informing myself and that's why I don't know if he did anything great in the last four years that's true, Habeck was much more present I think he is much more present now because I am in this left-green bubble and that's just in my social media more focused on me but I get a lot from Merzer and from Weidel obviously but Scholz is a little ghost I don't know but I have yesterday with Tom and my brother talked more or less about politics I want to wait and see how the elections go I think it's nice that the left have so much percent I wish they would come to 10 but yeah difficult let's see what's cooking good looking?",gow,12
00:00:00,,"we just wondered where Scholz was the last time so the last four years, not the last time Scholz just does cave diving into the smallest holes in the smallest cracks of Germany what is the cave diver in Germany?",gow,13
00:00:00,,"just disappeared okay here is the Little Nightmares DLC he does his thing in his underground bunker he does some shit and when he realizes it was shit he does it as if he forgot it and just doesn't talk about it I don't want to know what else he has that we will never know I just finished it, you mean the DLC?",gow,14
00:00:00,,"so you can't get spoiled look what Tom printed I have a beautiful controller holder controller holder even with gradient oops, sorry microphone look, just pink below it's so nice very pretty and it fits the colors I always have on my controller I think we are currently the weakest party in the Bundestag but it's definitely represented and we have a lot of time I think the FDP will probably come in and BSW will too I think the FDP it wouldn't be bad if they get 5% I think it's a good show it's just that these predictions are a bit different everywhere I saw the one from ZDF there was a 5% FDP according to Google, it's 4.9% so I don't know, we shall see but that's also a lot of surveys from the people who went out of the polling stations or?",gow,15
00:00:00,,"chapter selection I want to click in and actually have the sound please Tom, can you please change the game?",gow,16
00:00:00,,"ah, okay mine are from ZDF I don't know eh from 18.21, okay it's just shaking, thank you I have to go down, but why can I...",gow,17
00:00:00,,"we have 3 chapters left 3 DSC chapters so 0.1% can change I'm curious your progress in current chapter will be reset yes, it's okay we played through what, one chapter or the whole DSC?",gow,18

00:00:00,,That's really great.,gow,1756
00:00:00,,I like it.,gow,1757
00:00:00,,The concept art is crashing your PC.,gow,1758
00:00:00,,Hm.,gow,1759
00:00:00,,What?,gow,1760
00:00:00,,How do you get them?,gow,1761
00:00:00,,By getting the collectibles.,gow,1762
00:00:00,,I don't know.,gow,1763
00:00:00,,I don't know.,gow,1764
00:00:00,,I don't know.,gow,1765
00:00:00,,I don't know.,gow,1766
00:00:00,,I don't know.,gow,1767
00:00:00,,I don't know.,gow,1768
00:00:00,,How he gets collectibles.,gow,1769
00:00:00,,Or how or what.,gow,1770
00:00:00,,Okay.,gow,1771
00:00:00,,So Little Nightmares 1 is over.,gow,1772
00:00:00,,Completely over.,gow,1773
00:00:00,,Good game.,gow,1774
00:00:00,,So I found the ending really sad.,gow,1775
00:00:00,,It's really sad.,gow,1776
00:00:00,,It's really sad.,gow,1777
00:00:00,,It has already made me a little...,gow,1778
00:00:00,,I will think about that.,gow,1779
00:00:00,,"Yes, good little game.",gow,1780
00:00:00,,I think the game itself is really nice.,gow,1781
00:00:00,,The DLC has definitely convinced me.,gow,1782
00:00:00,,I'm really excited for the second part.,gow,1783
00:00:00,,I definitely want to watch an explanation video after we've played the second part.,gow,1784
00:00:00,,Because I missed a lot of details in the save.,gow,1785
00:00:00,,"You probably know them, but I don't.",gow,1786
00:00:00,,And the world is not 100% self-explanatory.,gow,1787
00:00:00,,So let's see.,gow,1788
00:00:00,,I want to get into it.,gow,1789
00:00:00,,That's important.,gow,1790
00:00:00,,I like to get together.,gow,1791
00:00:00,,What's going on?,gow,1792
00:00:00,,It's not quite a puzzle puzzle.,gow,1793
00:00:00,,I think there's a lot to it.,gow,1794
00:00:00,,For free imagination.,gow,1795
00:00:00,,"It's not really a festival, but they wanted this ugly world.",gow,1796
00:00:00,,"It has a story, but you can interpret a lot of it.",gow,1797
00:00:00,,And that's cool.,gow,1798
00:00:00,,But you can probably read a lot of things from the world.,gow,1799
00:00:00,,That's why I'm like...,gow,1800
00:00:00,,...funfaked or something like that.,gow,1801
00:00:00,,I always find that really cool.,gow,1802
00:00:00,,I'm always really into that.,gow,1803
00:00:00,,I interpreted it in a way that the otome killed us and we played a wichtel.,gow,1804
00:00:00,,That mourned us afterwards.,gow,1805
00:00:00,,"I mean, wasn't there the one wichtel that hung with the protagonist for a while?",gow,1806
00:00:00,,There's a wichtel that's always behind us.,gow,1807
00:00:00,,Or do you mean the six?,gow,1808
00:00:00,,"But the thing is, I was this boy, this runaway boy.",gow,1809
00:00:00,,"And we were transformed, not killed.",gow,1810
00:00:00,,We were made into a gnome.,gow,1811
00:00:00,,"But Sandim says, for example, that such a stinking gnome wouldn't be like that.",gow,1812
00:00:00,,And I thought that these gnomes were all prehistoric children who tried to kill.,gow,1813
00:00:00,,And then they become gnome.,gow,1814
00:00:00,,"So a stinking gnome, okay.",gow,1815
00:00:00,,"Then yes, we're going to drink a project zombie, kids.",gow,1816
00:00:00,,That doesn't help at all.,gow,1817
00:00:00,,But I still have to join the server.,gow,1818
00:00:00,,I have to plant things now.,gow,1819
00:00:00,,And I don't want to do that with the streamer yet.,gow,1820
00:00:00,,Maybe you're in the mood to watch me while I'm zomboing.,gow,1821
00:00:00,,Maybe you're in the mood to finally join the server.,gow,1822
00:00:00,,I'm cooking you really cool food.,gow,1823
00:00:00,,Unlimited beans.,gow,1824
00:00:00,,"It's unlimited beans time, guys.",gow,1825
00:00:00,,I'm going to eat a lot of beans.,gow,1826
00:00:00,,I'm going to eat a lot of beans.,gow,1827
00:00:00,,"It's unlimited beans time, guys.",gow,1828
00:00:00,,There was no hope of survival.,gow,1829
00:00:00,,This is how you died.,gow,1830
00:00:00,,"Yes, I know.",gow,1831
00:00:00,,I've played this game before.,gow,1832
00:00:00,,I did die many times.,gow,1833
00:00:00,,That's okay.,gow,1834
00:00:00,,Hello?,gow,1835
00:00:00,,Here are my top songs from last year.,gow,1836
00:00:00,,I need to...,gow,1837
00:00:00,,"Okay, I'm going to be seen.",gow,1838
00:00:00,,Do you want to drive into the pub?,gow,1839
00:00:00,,"Yes, but I want to find the ugliest outfit.",gow,1840
00:00:00,,I want a really stupid bomber jacket.,gow,1841
00:00:00,,I want a pink bomber jacket.,gow,1842
00:00:00,,And I know someone dropped it from the dead.,gow,1843
00:00:00,,So I will go get it.,gow,1844
00:00:00,,This song is really cool.,gow,1845
00:00:00,,And we have to drive into the library because we're missing a book for Carpentry.,gow,1846
00:00:00,,But I need a good fit for that.,gow,1847
00:00:00,,I want a different pair of pants.,gow,1848
00:00:00,,I killed one of them.,gow,1849
00:00:00,,"No, this stupid jacket was in a house up here.",gow,1850
00:00:00,,"Wait, I have flashlight.",gow,1851
00:00:00,,Now I'm standing here and I'm being grabbed.,gow,1852

00:00:00,,It do be dark.,gow,1860
00:00:00,,Mate.,gow,1861
00:00:00,,That's why I say yes.,gow,1862
00:00:00,,I can imagine that Leon doesn't have any cat eyes.,gow,1863
00:00:00,,And that's why it's so dark for him.,gow,1864
00:00:00,,Axe!,gow,1865
00:00:00,,That's my axe!,gow,1866
00:00:00,,Kentucky baseball cap.,gow,1867
